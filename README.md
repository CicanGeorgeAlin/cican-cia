# CICAN CIA

CICAN CIA is an independent educational interface for exploring publicly available and declassified historical intelligence records.

## Experience

The site uses a fictional access-path simulation inspired by real intelligence concepts:

**RECRUIT → ANALYST → CONFIDENTIAL → SECRET → TOP SECRET → COMPARTMENT**

Important: U.S. national-security classification has three formal levels: **Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret**. SCI, SAP, and compartmentation are controlled-access concepts rather than additional classification levels. The CICAN stages use these ideas as gameplay language and do not provide or represent access to classified information.

## CICAN interaction

The original locked CICAN interaction is preserved:

- Start size: 34
- Growth: +0.5
- Maximum size: exactly 180
- Movement interpolation: x += (targetX - x) * 0.10 and y += (targetY - y) * 0.10
- Double-tap window: 350ms
- Split placement: +45
- Merge distance: 20
- FULL + FULL → merge → record access
- FULL + small → merge, no record access
- small + small → merge, no record access

The interaction is the access mechanism, not decoration.

## Source policy

Records shown by the interface must point to real public sources. The primary source is the CIA FOIA Electronic Reading Room:

https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/

The project must never fabricate a CIA document, claim access to current classified information, or imply that the user has received a real security clearance.

## Current build

- index.html — landing/access briefing
- decode.html — CICAN access-path simulation and public-record gateway
- decode-v1-working-backup.html — preserved working baseline before the access-path upgrade

## Direction

The next major layer is a growing, source-mapped archive: topic → real CIA collection/record → CICAN challenge → original document. The experience should make the user feel that they earned the next piece while keeping every source traceable to public material.
